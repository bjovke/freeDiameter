### Very short install notes for Fedora (tested on Fedora 13 and 14)
# Please refer to other INSTALL files for more detailed instructions (e.g. extension-specific notes).


Dependencies on Fedora 13 (from minimal system):
# yum install cmake make gcc flex bison lksctp-tools-devel gnutls-devel libgcrypt-devel
# yum install mercurial

Following dependencies are optional, depending on which extensions you plan to compile
 app_acct:
	# yum install postgresql-server postgresql-devel

 app_sip:
 app_diameap:
	# yum install mysql-server mysql-devel
	
 dict_legacy_xml:
	# yum install libxml2 libxml2-devel
	
 dbg_interactive:
	# yum install swig python-devel


Fetching the latest source:
# hg clone http://www.freediameter.net/hg/freeDiameter
# cd freeDiameter

Compiling in a separate directory:
# mkdir test.build
# cd test.build
# cmake ..
# make

NOTE: You may need to change something in SELinux to allow binding the SCTP socket on Diameter port.
The following command is the very naive way to do it, you can probably do better (feedback appreciated!)
# setenforce Permissive


There is currently no Fedora-specific package for freeDiameter.
You are welcome to contribute packaging scripts! Please contact with
