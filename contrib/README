This file describes the content of the "contrib" directory. 
For information about the freeDiameter project, please refer
to top-level README file.

- update_copyright.sh : This script will simply update the copyright information
        in all source files in the freeDiameter mercurial repository, based
	on the last modification time. Thought I might share it if other people find
	it useful for their own project...

- PKI : This directory contains useful material related to establishing a 
        Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for deploying x509 certificates 
	and use these for TLS authentication of the freeDiameter nodes.
	
        IMPORTANT: Please note that these solutions are NOT suitable 
	for use in a production environment! It allows easy deployment of 
	certificates for tests, and that is their sole purpose.
    
        The directory contains:
	
    - ca_script: a simple Makefile allowing you to generate a self-signed certificate (root)
                and then issue new certificates and private keys for your users.
		Run "make" without argument to get the help.
		
    - ca_script2: An evolution of the previous Makefile. This one allows you
    		to create a hierarchy of CA and certificates. 

    - phpki-0.82.patch : This patch is to be applied to PHPki to customize the use for freeDiameter.
                PHPki (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpki/) is a PHP-based web interface
		that provides more or less the same services as ca_script.

- OpenWRT : This directory contains the scripts and documentation related to 
	the integration of freeDiameter RADIUS/Diameter gateway component in the openWRT
	distribution (http://openwrt.org) -- the goal is to give the access point the 
	ability to "talk" Diameter instead of RADIUS.
