Package: freediameter-common
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: The libfreeDiameter library.
 This library is required by all freeDiameter components.
 It may also be useful for other projects which need to 
 perform operations on Diameter messages. 
 .
 See 'freeDiameter-dev' package to retrieve the API for the library.

Package: freediameter-dev
Architecture: any
Depends: freediameter-daemon (= ${binary:Version}), libsctp-dev, libgnutls-dev, libgcrypt-dev
Description: This package provides the development files for freeDiameter.

Package: freediameter-daemon
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, freediameter-common (= ${binary:Version})
Suggests: ssl-cert, freediameter-dictionary-rfc4005, freediameter-dictionary-rfc4072
Description: The freeDiameter daemon. 
 The freeDiameter daemon provides support for the Diameter
 Base Protocol. Without any extension, the daemon can only
 be used as a Diameter routing agent. You probably want to 
 install some freeDiameter extension(s) to extend its 
 features.
 .
 The daemon is shipped with a small set of extensions, for
 example to configure the routing behavior. See the 
 examples for more details.

Package: freediameter-debug-tools
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, freediameter-daemon (= ${binary:Version})
Description: freeDiameter debug tools.
 This package provides useful tools to help tracking 
 problems in freeDiameter installation.

Package: freediameter-dictionary-rfc4005
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, freediameter-daemon (= ${binary:Version})
Description: RFC4005 (NASREQ) dictionary support.
 This freeDiameter extension provides the dictionary support
 for commands and AVP defined in RFC4005 (NASREQ).
 .
 In order to use this extension, your main freeDiameter 
 configuration file must contain a LoadExtension directive. 
 See freeDiameter documentation for more details. 
 .
 This extension does not require a configuration file.

Package: freediameter-dictionary-rfc4072
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, freediameter-dictionary-rfc4005 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: RFC4072 (Diameter EAP) dictionary support.
 This freeDiameter extension provides the dictionary support
 for commands and AVP defined in RFC4072 (Diameter EAP).
 .

Package: freediameter-radius-gateway
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, freediameter-dictionary-rfc4072 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: RADIUS/Diameter extensible gateway.
 This freeDiameter extension implements a RADIUS to Diameter
 gateway. It allows a RADIUS client to connect to a Diameter
 server.
 .
 The support for specific Diameter applications and/or RADIUS 
 extensions is provided in the gateway by the use of plugins.
 Currently, the following plugins are available:
  - echodrop.rgwx : drop or echo a RADIUS attribute. 
                    The attribute is not converted to Diameter.
		    See echodrop.rgwx.conf.sample for details.
  - auth.rgwx : Convert Access-Request to Diameter AAR or DER.
                Requests For Comments: RADIUS: 2865, 3162, 2868,
		2869, 3579; Diameter: 4005, 4072.
  - acct.rgwx : Converts Accounting-Request (2866) to Diameter 
                ACR (3588).
 .
 In order to use this extension, your main freeDiameter 
 configuration file must contain a LoadExtension directive.
