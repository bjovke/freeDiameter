QUICK INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

1) Install Homebrew

   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

2) Starting from version 1.1.5, a brew is available for freeDiameter: 

   brew install freediameter-server


Thanks to Moxie Dee for contribution of this package.

FROM SOURCES
------------

1) Dependencies
 a) install Xcode from App Store
 b) install homebrew (might require to re-install perl and git also)
 c) brew install the following packages:
   cmake mercurial gnutls mysql postgresql

2) Retrieve source folder
 hg clone http://www.freediameter.net/hg/freeDiameter

3) Configure your build -- execute from your build folder
 ccmake /path/to/freeDiameter/sources

 (you have to disable IDN and SCTP at the moment, before initial configuration)
Example:
  mkdir freeDiameter-build
  cd freeDiameter-build
  ccmake -DDISABLE_SCTP:BOOL=ON -DDIAMID_IDNA_IGNORE:BOOL=ON /path/to/freeDiameter/sources
  /* Select 'c' then choose your options, then 'c' again and 'g' */
  make

4) make

/* note: on my system I have to make a second time for compilation to complete, it seems something is wrong with swig processing order */

These instructions have been tested on Mac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). 
They should work smoothly on more recent versions as well.
